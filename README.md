Crop Yield Prediction

📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting crop yields based on various factors such as soil quality, weather conditions, and crop types. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the project aims to provide accurate and actionable insights for farmers, agricultural policymakers, and stakeholders to optimize agricultural productivity.

🧑‍💻 Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns and trends in crop yields.
Machine Learning Models: Developing predictive model DecisionTreeRegressor.
